            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p> Poisoned Hestia is a german rock band, formed in 1991 under the moniker “13th Floor”,
                playing some kind of devil music, influenced by late 80’s alternative sub-culture genres
                like Gothic Rock, Heavy Metal, Post-Punk, Wave and Industrial.
                The band quickly achieved local underground fame with their intense live presence,
                playing regular club gigs and regional festivals. Eventually, after a split and
                a short lived reformation, in 1995 the band went on hiatus, without ever having
                officially released any of their original material.</p>

                <p>The year 2019 marks the reunion of the original core members and the band
                finally delivered the long-awaited debut album, containing all of their
                classic songs alongside a few new and previously unheard tracks, in all their
                powerful and glittering glory. 
                    
                    Be prepared. - Words can kill.</p>
